# Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure. For example, the numerical order is a commonly used sequence but a lexicographical order is also a commonly used sequence type. There are several types of sorting algorithms: quick sort, bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort, radix sort, bucket sort among others. Each has its own properties and are suited to specific types of tasks and data.
# Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It gets its name because with each iteration the largest element “bubbles” up to its proper location. It continues this process of swapping until the entire list is sorted in ascending order. The main steps of the algorithm are: starting from the beginning of the list, compare every pair of adjacent items and swap them if they are in the wrong order, and then pass through the list until no more swaps are needed. However, despite being simple, Bubble Sort is not suited for large datasets as it has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(n²), where n is the number of items being sorted.
